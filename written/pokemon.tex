mention how pokemon runs with low hardware running

-tree only holding weights allows for easy iterative improvement without haveing to recalculate 
a neural network and backpropagte on user devices (could for instance do a patch updating the
tree weights to improve AI)

-by having a single network and no predicition although a simplified model greatly reduces the computational
effort and time to select a move
